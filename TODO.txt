CLARIFICATION
- Can there be more than one operation? If so, will the string be formatted with parenthesis?
  - EX: 1/2 * 3_3/4 + 3/4 - 1/4
- Will it need to support negative numbers as input? If so, how will they be formatted?
- Does the CLI need to be called with "?" as in the example? Would it be acceptable to call "calc 3/4 * 3/5"?

CLI with minimist (MAKE INSTALLATION SCRIPT)
Tests with Jest

Can return improper? can do polish notation? [FLAGS]
Always return mixed if no flag

Error handling
  red color

Fraction class
 - internally always parsed & improper
   - must support whole numbers
 - parse/serialize (4/3 -> [4,3])
   - could have numerator and denominator attrs
 - simplify (5/15 -> 1/3)
 - to_improper (1_1/3 -> 4/3)
 - to_mixed (4/3 -> 1_1/3) 
 - to_reciprocal (1/2 -> 2/1) 
 - lcm [least common denominator/multiple] (4,5 is 20)

 Add
  - lcm, add numerators, simplify, to mixed 
 Multiply
  - multiply numerators/multiply denominators, simplify, to mixed 
 Divide
  - fraction #2 to reciprocal, then call multiply
 Subtract
  - lcm, subtract numerators, simplify, to mixed 

Command -> split by allowed operands -> serialize fractions 1 & 2
  split by operands
    no more than one, in sequence
    only *, /, +, -
    operand determines which operation function is called
