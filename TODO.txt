I left this file in order to show some amount of thinking process - I would normally remove this file.

CLARIFICATION
- Can there be more than one operation? If so, will the string be formatted with parenthesis?
  - EX: 1/2 * 3_3/4 + 3/4 - 1/4
- Will it need to support negative numbers as input? If so, how will they be formatted?
- Does the CLI need to be called with "?" as in the example? Would it be acceptable to call "calc 3/4 * 3/5"?
- Does the CLI always output mixed fractions or whole numbers (never improper)?
- The asterix character for multiplication operations is misinterpreted by the shell (gives filenames instead). Is it okay to ask the user to run 'set -f' or use 'x' instead?

CLI with minimist (MAKE INSTALLATION SCRIPT)
Tests with Jest

Can return improper? can do polish notation? [FLAGS]
Always return mixed if no flag

Error handling
  red color

Negative in numerator, when whole number is present is not valid input. i.e. "1_-1/4" is invalid
-1_-1/4 invalid
no two negative signs, negative only on whole if there is one,
negative only on numerator if no whole


Fraction class
 - internally always parsed & improper
   - must support whole numbers
 - parse/serialize (4/3 -> [4,3])
   - could have numerator and denominator attrs
 - simplify (5/15 -> 1/3)
 - to_improper (1_1/3 -> 4/3)
 - to_mixed (4/3 -> 1_1/3) 
 - to_reciprocal (1/2 -> 2/1) 
 - lcm [least common denominator/multiple] (4,5 is 20)
 - gcf [greatest common factor] (45,10 is 5)

 Add
  - lcm, add numerators, simplify, to mixed 
 Multiply
  - multiply numerators/multiply denominators, simplify, to mixed 
 Divide
  - fraction #2 to reciprocal, then call multiply
 Subtract
  - lcm, subtract numerators, simplify, to mixed 

Command -> split by allowed operands -> serialize fractions 1 & 2
  split by operands
    no more than one, in sequence
    only *, /, +, -
    operand determines which operation function is called
